In the past year, I have started using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) quite a lot. I have also dabbled with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and I have started to like building web apps with TypeScript.

Fortunately, it's very easy use TypeScript while creating a new React app:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

Or to create the app in the current directory:
```bash
npx create-react-app --template typescript .
```
